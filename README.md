NeuroSentinel – AI-Driven Real-Time Phishing Detection Using Emotional Intelligence and Behavioural Analysis is a smart cybersecurity system designed to tackle one of the most persistent threats in digital communication: phishing emails. Unlike traditional spam filters or rule-based methods that rely on fixed patterns like keywords or sender blacklists, NeuroSentinel uses a hybrid artificial intelligence approach to detect phishing attempts more accurately and in real time.
The system combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with behavioral analysis to assess the intent, tone, and structure of incoming emails. It leverages a pretrained transformer model (DistilBERT) to understand the emotional and linguistic cues in the email content, such as urgency or fear-based manipulation. Simultaneously, it uses a gradient boosting classifier (LightGBM) to evaluate the metadata—such as sender domain, number of links, and structure of URLs—to identify hidden threats. These two independent scores are then fused to calculate a final phishing probability score.
The solution is integrated into a web-based dashboard, allowing users to either paste or fetch emails (e.g., from Gmail/Outlook) and receive immediate feedback about their safety. It not only labels an email as Safe, Suspicious, or Phishing, but also explains the decision in human-understandable terms—for example, by highlighting reasons like “Urgent tone” or “Unknown sender domain.”
The complete system includes backend logic (using FastAPI or Flask), a frontend dashboard (built with React), and a machine learning engine. Extensive testing has shown high accuracy and low false positive rates, demonstrating that this hybrid AI model is far more effective than traditional filters. NeuroSentinel offers a future-ready, explainable, and user-focused defense against evolving phishing threats, making it a powerful tool for email security in academic, corporate, or personal use
